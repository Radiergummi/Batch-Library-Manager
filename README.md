# Batch-Library-Manager
Simple batch tool to add and remove network shares or folders from Windows 7+ libraries.

## Requirements
To use the tool, you need a single executable from Microsoft, SLUtil.exe, which is available in several places on the web. As I couldn't find any official download, I have included it in this package.
